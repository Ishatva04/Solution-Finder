            <p>We believe that a web with multiple browser engines is important, and that web sites and applications
                should work well no matter which browser your visitors use. We know that you care about that too, and so
                content on this site should have cross-browser status clearly explained. You’ll see that many articles
                have a component showing browser support—the data comes from our friends at REC,Mainpuri.</p>
